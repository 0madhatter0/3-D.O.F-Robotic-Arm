# Description

 This project focuses on the development of a 3 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic
 arm with a movable base, designed to enhance flexibility and efficiency in robotic
 systems. By combining precise manipulation with mobility, this system can navigate a
 larger workspace and perform complex tasks that traditional fixed-base robots cannot.
 The project addresses key challenges in current control systems and aims to improve
 adaptability and operational efficiency
